# WP-REST-OutputControle
Wordpress Plugin that offers controls over what and under which conditions WP-REST-API outputs

I wanted to be able to change what WP-REST-API is outputting.
I have personal routes and endpoints and need to be able to, fast and easily, switch between either 
broadcasting these custom routes or not.
Therefore I decided to build this plugin.

Next to that I needed to be able to switch between requiering authentication or not.

Currently this plugin is under development and DOES NOT offer above mentioned functionality....yet :)


Please be aware that I'm a novice PHP, javascript and css programmer and that this is my first attempt to develop a WP plugin.
If you believe you are able to improve, don't hesitate to join!

Mario
